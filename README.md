# Solid Earth

> **Planned. This repository holds no capability yet; it exists so the
> organization's target shape is visible. Nothing here is installable.**

A domain capability: discipline Solid Earth inside the Geosphere sphere. Pillar means sphere: one of the five Earth science spheres; a capability is skills, knowledge signed by its stewards and deterministic checks, delivered as one plugin.

## Use something today

Nothing in this repository installs. The capabilities that do are in the
marketplace, and each brings the foundation and the provider knowledge
with it:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add open-science-pillars/marketplace
claude plugin install ocean-science@open-science-pillars   # or hydrology, or core
```

On Claude Cowork, add the same marketplace from Customize > Plugins and
install from it. The [tutorials](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/tutorials)
take ten to thirty minutes; the [glossary](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/marketplace/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md) says what a sphere,
a capability and a knowledge bundle are.

## Intended scope

Surface deformation, seismic and volcanic processes, geodesy and the
gravity field: what the surface and the interior do, measured from orbit
and from the ground.

## Ownership

Owned by @open-science-pillars/geosphere-maintainers (`CODEOWNERS`); one person
holds the team during the interim solo period, and accepting a
maintainer is a membership change, never a rearrangement.

Candidate provider stewards, who would sign the facts a capability
here relies on: ASF DAAC (SAR and InSAR) and CDDIS (space geodesy). None engaged yet.

## What to do here

- **A scientist**: use core, ocean-science or hydrology now; watch this
  repository for its first release; describe the analyses you would want
  from this discipline in the marketplace
  [Discussions](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/marketplace/discussions).
- **A candidate steward at one of the data centers named above**: open
  the new domain capability issue in the organization's
  [.github](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/.github) repository;
  a capability here starts with the people who sign its facts.
- **A maintainer**: promotion out of planned is governed, cross-cutting
  work, never a quiet commit: a dated entry in the
  [pre-registered plan](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/marketplace/blob/main/docs/phase2-preregistration.md),
  a steward who signs, a knowledge bundle that conforms to the knowledge
  format and is validated in evals, and only then the package, surfaces
  and runtime metadata that the planned status forbids. The proposal is
  decided under the roadmap proposal labels.

## What stays out while planned

No `SKILL.md`, no `.osp/package.yaml` or `.osp/surfaces.yaml`, no
runtime manifest (`.claude-plugin`, `plugin.json`, `mcp.json`), no
marketplace catalog entry, no release, no `CITATION.cff`. The gate
runs build-kit's `osp.py validate`, which refuses each of them for a
repository whose status is planned, so the honest banner above cannot
drift from what the tree contains.

## Place in the organization

What this repository is and how far along it is are declared once, in
`.osp/repository.yaml`; the organization profile, build-kit's
[sphere view](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/build-kit/blob/main/SPHERE-VIEW.md) and the
GitHub topics are rendered from that file, never the other way round.
The decision record is ADR A in [marketplace/docs/decisions](https://github.com/open-science-pillars/marketplace/tree/main/docs/decisions).
